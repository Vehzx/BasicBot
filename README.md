# BasicBot

BasicBot is a discord bot template made with .js, created for others to use as a starting point in creating their own discord bot.

# Status

As stated above this projected is to give users a starting point in creating their own discord bots.

This project will NOT be updated to contain more features, please do not create feature requests as they will be ignored.

# Help

If you are new to coding, I have attatched documentation for basic discord bot creation within the main.js file.

Documentations will also be linked below, discussions are open on the github page, although we also have a community discord for people to share code and ideas.
